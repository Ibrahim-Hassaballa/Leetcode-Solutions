## Description

This pull request introduces a new directory structure to the repository, which better organizes the codebase and improves maintainability. The new structure is designed to make it easier to find specific solutions to problems, and to encourage modular design principles.


## Contributing Guidelines

- **Match the casing of files and directories**
- Creation of a `solutions` directory, which contains all the code solutions.
- Inside `solutions`, there are subdirectories for each programming language used in the solutions.
- Inside each language directory, there are further subdirectories for each problem, identified by its Number of problem and name of the problem . (e.g. _"Create: 1-Two-Sum.py"_)
- **Give your PR a succinct and accurate title** (e.g. _"Create: 1-Two-Sum.py"_)
- **Make sure your code passes** submission on [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) for the problem it solves
- **Write clean code** (Your code should use semantically meaningful variable/method names, consistent style, etc) and easy to understand. for example, a single letter is probably not a semantically meaningful name
- **Ensure the problem is not already solved** in the language you're contributing in


## Levels of problems :
- inside each level in the readme file if the table has not coloumn for your solution language add your column and link your soultion in this coloumn .
- if already the table has a coloumn for your language solution , you need just link your solution and ensure the problem is not already solved.


**Q:** What if there are multiple ways to solve the problem?

**A:** choose the best solution by (Time complexity & memory complexity ).
